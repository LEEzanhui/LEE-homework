## part two
1)Method of complements  
>In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. 

2)Byte  
>The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number.

3)Integer (computer science)  
>In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

4)Floating point  
>In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. 

## part three

证明二进制的补码的原理（反码加一）
>The radix complement of an n digit number y in radix b is, by definition, {\displaystyle b^{n}-y} b^{n}-y. The radix complement is most easily obtained by adding 1 to the diminished radix complement, which is {\displaystyle (b^{n}-1)-y} (b^{n}-1)-y. Since {\displaystyle (b^{n}-1)} (b^{n}-1) is the digit {\displaystyle b-1} b-1 repeated n times (because {\displaystyle b^{n}-1=(b-1)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}+...+b+1)=(b-1)b^{n-1}+...+(b-1)} {\displaystyle b^{n}-1=(b-1)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}+...+b+1)=(b-1)b^{n-1}+...+(b-1)}; see also Geometric series Formula), the diminished radix complement of a number is found by complementing each digit with respect to {\displaystyle b-1} b-1 (that is, subtracting each digit in y from {\displaystyle b-1} b-1).
The subtraction of y from x may be performed as follows. Adding the diminished radix complement of x to y results in the value {\displaystyle b^{n}-1-x+y} b^{n}-1-x+y or {\displaystyle b^{n}-1-(x-y)} b^{n}-1-(x-y) which is the diminished radix complement of {\displaystyle x-y} x-y, except for possible padding digits {\displaystyle b-1} b-1. The diminished radix complement of this is the value {\displaystyle x-y} x-y. Alternatively, adding the radix complement of y to x results in the value {\displaystyle x+b^{n}-y} x+b^{n}-y or {\displaystyle x-y+b^{n}} x-y+b^{n}. Assuming y ≤ x , the result will always be greater or equal to {\displaystyle b^{n}} b^{n} and dropping the initial '1' is the same as subtracting {\displaystyle b^{n}} b^{n}, making the result {\displaystyle x-y+b^{n}-b^{n}} x-y+b^{n}-b^{n} or just {\displaystyle x-y} x-y, the desired result.

What does NaN mean?

>IEEE 754(浮点数格式)specifies a special value called "Not a Number" (NaN) to be returned as the result of certain "invalid" operations, such as 0/0, ∞×0, or sqrt(−1).
