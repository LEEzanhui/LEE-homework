# 作业有关伪代码与算法
## 1、阅读 Pseudocode Standard。（答案可以打印）  
1）用伪代码描述将十进制转换成16进制的方法  
2）C语言实现（先用注释写好算法，然后翻译）  
///C
#include<stdio.h>

char hex(int);

int main(){
	int a, i;
	scanf("%d", &a);    //输入  
	char ans[100];
//转化
	for(i = 0;a != 0; i++){
		ans[i] = hex(a%16);
		a = a/16;
	} 
	i--;
//打印  
	for(;i>=0; i--){
		printf("%c", ans[i]);
	}
	return 0;
}
char hex(int num){
	char letter = num+'0';  //将1~9转化成字符的1~9  
	switch(num){
		case 10:letter = 'A';
			break;
		case 11:letter = 'B';
			break;
		case 12:letter = 'C';
			break;
		case 13:letter = 'D';
			break;	
		case 14:letter = 'E';
			break;	
		case 15:letter = 'F';
			break;
	}
	return letter;
}

3）使用 -1, 0, 1, 15, 26，3265 最为输入测试你的程序  
## 2、名词解释与对比  
1）Top-down design  
Top-down approaches emphasize planning and a complete understanding of the system. It is inherent that no coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design of at least some part of the system. Top-down approaches are implemented by attaching the stubs in place of the module. This, however, delays testing of the ultimate functional units of a system until significant design is complete.  
Top-down is a programming style, the mainstay of traditional procedural languages, in which design begins by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces. The technique for writing a program using top–down methods is to write a main procedure that names all the major functions it will need. Later, the programming team looks at the requirements of each of those functions and the process is repeated. These compartmentalized sub-routines eventually will perform actions so simple they can be easily and concisely coded. When all the various sub-routines have been coded the program is ready for testing. By defining how the application comes together at a high level, lower level work can be self-contained. By defining how the lower level abstractions are expected to integrate into higher level ones, interfaces become clearly defined.  

2） Work breakdown structure (WBS)  
A work-breakdown structure (WBS) in project management and systems engineering, is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. A work breakdown structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections.   
The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK 5) defines the work-breakdown structure "A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables."  

3）简述管理学 WBS 与 信息学Top-down设计 的异同  
同：核心都是将一个项目分解成多个子项目，以提高工作效率  
异：wbs涵盖更多方面，如文档归类等，且更加抽象。软件工程中也有自下而上的编程思想。
